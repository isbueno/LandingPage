# WebProject

This is a web project template that I made during the classes of the web development course in the second semester of college. The goal of this site is to create a community of readers, where they can interact, favorite, and comment on their favorite books. 

The project relies on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a database will be implemented in the future.
